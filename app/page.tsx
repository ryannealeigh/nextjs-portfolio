        I'm a coffee enthusiast and fountain pen aficionado, currently working at <a href="https://amazon.com">Amazon</a>,
        where I design and build flexible APIs and backend services that improve data accessibility, streamline complex
        processes, and empower developers across diverse projects. Outside of work, Iâ€™m often experimenting with pour-over
        coffee, meticulously weighing beans and fine-tuning each cup. I also enjoy writing and organizing thoughts in my
        Leuchtturm1917 notebook with a Hongdian fountain pen. A huge science fiction and fantasy fan, I love getting lost in worlds like <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, <em>The Cosmere</em>, <em>The Expanse</em>, and the <em>Halo</em> novel series.
